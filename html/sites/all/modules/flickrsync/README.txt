The Flickr Sync module downloads new photos from Flickr and creates Drupal nodes from them.  The sync includes the title, description, tags (as Drupal taxonomy terms), and of course the image as a CCK imagefield upload.

This module does NOT provide any image gallery view or other theming.

This modules requires Flickr API module.
